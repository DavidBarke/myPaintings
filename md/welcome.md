## Login and Users

Users may log in using the interface in the upper-right corner. Every user has a unique user name and a password. For demonstration 100 random users exist. Their user names can be seen below. For convenience the user password is the **first name** of a user starting with a **lower case** letter (e.g. the password of `Jane Doe` is `jane`). There is one admin account with user name `Admin` and password `admin`.

That's all you need to know to start your journey. Enjoy browsing!
