# Short Description

Browse and collect over 30,000 paintings from the 13th to the 19th century. Users may trade paintings with each other. Every user has her/his personal collection and wallet. Infinite scroll and custom image boxes account for a appealing display.

# Long Description

myPaintings is my take on the [Summer 2021 - Shopfiy Developer Intern Challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZKRywXQLZWOqVOHC4JkF3LqdpO3Llpfk_CkZPR8bjak/edit). The task was to build an image repository. So I decided to crawl more than 30,000 images from the [Web Gallery of Art](https://www.wga.hu/).

## User Management

There are two types of users: `user` and `admin`. A `user` may collect and trade paintings, whereas an `admin` manages users and monitors the database. All users log in with user name and password.

## Views

A `user` has three different views on paintings:

* *Browse*: View all paintings
* *Collection*: View and offer paintings owned by this `user`
* *Buy*: View and buy paintings offered by other `user`s

Each view consists of a filter, further settings and the paintings display. The paintings display contains image boxes, that are loaded dynamically using custom infinite scroll.

## Filter

In each view all applicable paintings can be filtered by the following characteristics:

* *Title*
* *Painter*
* *School*
* *Type*
* *Status* (*offered* / *not offered*)

All characteristics but *Status* support three operations:

* `=`: Select exactly one available choice
* `IN`: Select multiple available choices
* `REGEXP`: Select available choices matching a regular expression

An arbitrary number of filter conditions can be added. Each subsequent condition is restricted by the results of the preceding condition (e.g. after you selected a particular *Painter*, a subsequent *Title* condition will only show the title of paintings of this painter as its choices).

## Trade Paintings

In the *Collection* view, a `user` may

* offer a painting for an arbitrary price
* change the price of an offered painting
* withdraw an offered painting

In the *Buy* view, a `user` may buy an offered painting from another `user`.

## Wallet

Each `user` has an account balance. Selling a painting increases the balance whereas buying a painting decreases it. In the tab *Wallet* a `user` can view all past transactions and filter them by date.

## Database

An `admin` may view all database tables in the tab *Database*. For demonstration purposes, all database tables are randomly initialised.

## Deployment

All images take up more than 4 GB of disk storage, which exceeds the upload bundle size for shinyapps.io. Therefore, I host the application on my private Shiny Server. Obviously, the images are ignored by the Git repository. For reproducibility the `data` folder contains a [script](https://github.com/DavidBarke/myPaintings/blob/master/data/process_catalog.R) that downloads all images from the [Web Gallery of Art](https://www.wga.hu/).
